<b>DeepBack</b>, a predictive model capable of determining corrected mass shifts in hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) profiles, was developed using a deep learning technique. To construct an input-output black-box mapping, the model was trained using in-house experimentally corrected HDX-MS data. <br /><br />
What is the significance of utilising this code? <br />
<br /> It is crucial to use corrected HDX-MS data when generating input for HDXmodeller, a modelling programme available on HDXsite (https://hdxsite.nms.kcl.ac.uk/). <br /> <br /> Python 3 or above, as well as the Python libraries Scikit-learn, NumPy, Scipy, Keras, and TensorFlow, are required to run the code.
