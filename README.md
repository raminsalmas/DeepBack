A deep learning approach was utilised to develop a model capable of predicting corrected mass shifts in hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) profiles. To construct an input-output black-box mapping, the model was trained using in-house experimentally corrected HDX-MS data. It is crucial to use corrected HDX-MS data when generating input for HDXmodeller, a modelling programme available on HDXsite (https://hdxsite.nms.kcl.ac.uk/). <br /> <br /> To run the code, the following Python libraries are required: Scikit-learn, Scipy, Keras, and TensorFlow.
